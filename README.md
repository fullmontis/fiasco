# Fiasco: a minimalistic, script based video editor using ffmpeg

Fiasco is a minimalistic scripting language used for quickly putting together
videos, using the FFMpeg encoder. Its main purpose is creating a 
layer of abstraction over the powerful but complex syntax of
FFMpeg, giving a set of basic operations commonly used in video editing.

Fiasco is written in Perl and released under the very liberal 
MIT license. Any contribution is permitted, and, in fact, encouraged.

For an example of the syntax, see the file videos.txt.

Usage:

    fiasco [script file] [output video]
